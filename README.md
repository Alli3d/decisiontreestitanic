# Titanic Survivor Test
A ML program that uses the [decision tree classifier library](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html) from Sklearn to determine whether a person would survive the Titanic crash based on given attributes (class, sex, age, paid fare). Other variables have been omitted.
Uses [the Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) from Kaggle.

## Usage
The algorithm is trained, then testing using the selected characteristics at run-time on `main.py`. It is not ready-made.

## Output
- Whether the person would survive (Y/N)
